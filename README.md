# SPA Skeleton

SPA Skeleton is a boilerplate for creating single-page applications (SPAs). It is built with Vite, utilizing Handlebars for templating and SCSS for styling.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js v14.21.3 (Recommended: Use a version manager like NVM)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/masaroli/spa-skeleton
   cd spa-skeleton
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```
    npm install

   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
    npm run dev
   ```

This will launch a local development server and open your SPA in a browser. The server supports hot module replacement for fast development.

To build production-ready files, use:

```
 npm run build
```
